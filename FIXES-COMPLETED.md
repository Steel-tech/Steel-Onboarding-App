## ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. **Logo File Issue - FIXED** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Application referenced `logo.png` which didn't exist, causing broken images.

- ‚úÖ Updated all HTML references to use the real company logo
- ‚úÖ Logo now appears in header, welcome section, footer, and browser tab
- ‚úÖ Removed placeholder SVG file

- Enhanced form validation with email format checking and required field validation
- Improved error messages and user feedback

### 3. **JavaScript Error Handling - ENHANCED**
