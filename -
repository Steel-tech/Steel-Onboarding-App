HOW TO 
READ & UNDERSTAND 
WELDING PROCEDURES

Line 1:-----
Verifies that this is a WPS (Welding Procedure Specification).


Line 2:-----

Line 3:-----
If the welding Procedure had to be qualified by testing the number of the PQR (Procedure Qualification Record) will be on the blank on this line.


Line 4:-----
This line has the WPS ID number on it, the last revision date & who the revision was by. 


Line 5:-----
This line has the Company who the WPS is for, Who authorized it & the date it was authorized.


Line 6:-----
This line gives the welding process SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding) STICK and whether it is manual or semi-automatic. Stick is manual and Wire is semi-automatic.


Line 7:-----
On this line would appear the PQR number if the Procedure was qualified by testing and was the weld process by machine or automatic.


Line 8:-----
This line gives the joint design which is referenced from the code book used. (AWS D1.1)


Line 9:-----
The type of weld single (all from one side), double (welded from both sides), the position of the weld (vertical) and was it a groove or fillet weld.


Line 10:----
Was backing used either yes or no in this case it is Yes, and if vertical is the progression up or down, in this procedure the progression is Up.


Line 11:----
What is the backing material? In this procedure any material listed in AWS D1.1Table 3.1 Group I & II can be used


Line 12:----
What is the root opening (in this procedure the root opening is 1/4 inch). There is not root face dimension as the bevel has no land on it.


Line 13:----
What is the groove angle for the procedure? In this procedure the angle is 45 degrees, this is the total included angle not the angle on each side of the plate. If it was a radiused groove, as when welding round bar to plate what is the radius. Las if using the GMAW Process what is the Transfer Mode.


Line 14:----
Is back gouging being performed and if Yes what is the method (i.e. grinding, arc gouging, etc.) In this procedure no back gouging is performed. If GMAW is used is the transfer method short circuiting, Globular or Spray.


Line 15:----
Type of currant AC, DCEP (Direct Currant Electrode Positive), DCEN (Direct Currant Electrode Negative), or Pulsed. In this procedure the type is DCEP. The electrode is hooked up to the positive terminal of the welding machine.


Line 16:----
What is the Material Specifications of the Base Metal? You can weld any metal in AWS D1.1 Table 3.1 Group I & II. For GMAW what type of Tungsten Electrode is used.


Line 17:----
What is the Type or Grade of the base metal? You can weld any metal in AWS D1.1 Table 3.1 Group I & II. What is the Size of the tungsten Electrode?


Line 18:----
What is the thickness of the base metal used in the groove or fillet weld/ In this procedure it is 3/8’s of an inch thick. 


Line 19:----
If a pipe procedure what is the Diameter of the pipe. N/A in this procedure.


Line 19.5--
What technique is used Stringer beads of weave beads? In this procedure Stringer or weave can be used.


Line 20:----
What is the AWS Specification for the Filler Metal being used? In this procedure it is A5.1. This number can be found on the electrode container. Is this a multi-pass or Single pass weld per side? In this procedure is a Multi-pass weld.


Line 21:----
What is the AWS Classification for the Filler Metal being used? In this procedure it is E-7018. This number can be found on the electrode container. How many electrodes are used in this procedure. For this Procedure the number is One.


Line 22:----
What is the Electrode Classification?  There is a table covering F1, F2, G3 & F4 electrodes in AWS D1.1. In this procedure E-7018 is an F4 Electrode. (This means you are qualified to weld any F4, F3, F2 or F1 electrode. You are permitted to weld an electrode in a lower numbered classification in what you certified on but can not weld in higher classified electrodes. On the right side if you are using multiple electrodes what is their Longitudinal Spacing.


Line 23:----
What type of shielding gas is being used? This is a N/A for this Procedure as E-7018 has flux on it. (i.e. self shielded)


Line 24:----
What Type of Flux or Gas are being used for the welding process? Both are N/A for this Procedure.


Line 25:----
What is the composition of the gas? (i.e. 100% CO2, 25% CO2 & 75% Argon, etc.) Contact Tube Work distance is N/a for this Procedure.


Line 26:----
Electrode Flux (Class0 N/A), Flow Rate of the Gas [X CFH [Cubic Feet Hour)], Is peening required or done and how, N/A in this Procedure.


Line 27:----
What is the Gas cup Size N/A for this Procedure? How is Interpass Cleaning done? In this Procedure chipper Hammer, Wire brush or grinding are allowed.


Line 28:----
What is the Minimum Pre-Heat temperature in degrees Fahrenheit? 50 Degrees is the Minimum temperature the metal can be to weld on it. (50 Degrees for the metal not the ambient air temperature. The steel can be mush colder than the air in the morning or on cool days.) Postweld Heat Treatment is N/A in this Procedure.


Line 29:----
1/8” to 3/4” inclusive None but note *. Over 3/4 to 1-1/2” inclusive 50 degrees Min. Time for Postweld Heat Treatment N/A for this Procedure.


Line 30:----
Over 1/12” to 2-1/2” inclusive 150 degrees Min. Over 2-12’ 225 degrees Min.
